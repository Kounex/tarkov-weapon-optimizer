# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tarkov Weapon Mod Optimizer.

## [v2.6.1] — 2026-07-28

### Added
- **JSON API fallback for game data** (`jsonApiAdapter.ts`). The tarkov.dev GraphQL API has had extended outages (HTTP 503 on every query since 2026-07-21, upstream issue the-hideout/tarkov-api#474). On any GraphQL failure the app now falls back to the maintainer-recommended JSON API (`json.tarkov.dev`), reshaping its responses (id-keyed item dicts, placeholder names + per-language translation overlays, trader-id offers, flat barter list) into the GraphQL item shape the solver already consumes — no downstream changes. GraphQL stays the primary source; fallback results are cached in IndexedDB like GraphQL results (`CACHE_VERSION` 15 → 16). GraphQL retries reduced from 3 (~14s worst case) to 2 quick attempts so the fallback kicks in fast.

### Fixed
- **Flea-market prices now track current listings instead of 24h averages.** Neither tarkov.dev API exposes individual active listings, so flea offers are now priced at the item's `lastLowPrice` (current cheapest listing) on both the GraphQL and JSON paths, and items reporting `lastOfferCount <= 0` are treated as flea-unavailable (previously an average-based flea price was used even when nothing was actually listed). Barter required-item unit costs now prefer `lastLowPrice` over `avg24hPrice`. `avg24hPrice` remains only in reference/display roles.

## [v2.5.5] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Force-refresh data button** (top-right reload icon, mobile menu entry): clears the browser's IndexedDB game-data cache and terminates the in-memory solver worker, then reloads the page so all data is re-fetched from tarkov.dev. Useful when a stale cache produces odd builds or when the project wants to pick up fresh wipe data without waiting for the 1-hour TTL to expire. Translations added for all 16 locales.

### Fixed
- **Performance preset weights changed from (50, 50, 0) to (48, 48, 2)** to break objective-function degeneracy. With `price_weight = 0`, any two builds that only differ in expensive negative-ergo / low-recoil parts (e.g. M203 + 20" barrel vs lighter layouts) had identical objective values after tie-breaker, so HiGHS could return wildly different solutions across WASM runtimes (observed: Chromium → 46.5 ergo / 47.4 recoil V, Firefox → 0.5 ergo / 40.2 recoil V on the same M4A1 LP). The 2% price nudge is small enough to preserve the "recoil + ergo" intent but large enough (≈ ₽7M swing on typical builds) to pick a single deterministic optimum.

## [v2.5.4] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Optimization no longer fails with `Unable to read LP model` on most assault rifles** (AK-74, M4A1, AKM, AK-74M, and any weapon whose reachable-mod tree contains a self-referencing conflict). Tarkov.dev's data lists a few items in their own `conflicting_items` array, so the LP builder emitted `conf_N: x_i + x_i <= 1`, and HiGHS's CPLEX LP reader rejects duplicate columns in a constraint row, aborting the whole parse. Added a `cid === iid` guard in the conflict loop so self-conflicts are silently dropped. Smaller rifles (e.g. AKS-74U) coincidentally avoided the bug because the self-conflicting item wasn't reachable from them. Unrelated to the v2.5.x MOA work — latent since the conflict loop was introduced.

## [v2.5.3] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **MOA values now match in-game display**. The conversion factor from BSG's internal `centerOfImpact` units to displayed MOA was wrong: we multiplied by 100, but the correct empirical factor is ≈ **34.3** (the widely-cited Tarkov community constant). Final MOA values were therefore ~2.9× too high — e.g. VPO-215 with its long/short barrels showed 4.10/6.00 on the site vs the real in-game 1.55/2.06; M700 barrels showed 1.41–2.35 vs the real sub-1. Added `MOA_K` constant in `lpBuilder.ts`, updated the LP big-M constraints (per-barrel + fallback + fixed-barrel), the final-stats display formula, and the weapon/barrel `base_moa` fields returned by the worker.
- Reverted a prior incorrect hypothesis that barrel COI *adds* to weapon intrinsic COI — BSG actually *replaces* when a replaceable barrel is installed, so `effectiveBaseCOI = barrelCOI > 0 ? barrelCOI : weaponCOI`.
- **Max MOA slider's displayed min no longer renders an infeasible cap**. Previously the exact floor was rounded to 2 decimals with `Math.round` — e.g. M700's true floor 0.4836 displayed as 0.48, but setting `maxMOA = 0.48` was infeasible. Switched to `Math.ceil` so the slider's leftmost position is always reachable (costs +0.005 MOA of display precision). Removed a re-flooring pass inside `WeightAdjuster` that undid the ceiling.

### Changed
- Result stats card now shows MOA with 3 decimal places (was 2), so small accuracy differences between mod choices are visible.
- Removed the orange base-MOA tick from the Max MOA slider — for weapons with replaceable barrels the intrinsic value isn't reachable anyway, and showing it cluttered the slider.

## [v2.5.2] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Exact MOA floor now correctly reports the true minimum** for weapons like M16A1/ADAR where accuracy-boosting mods exist deep in the slot graph. Previously the floor-finder used linear cap-tightening (0.005 per step, 12 iterations) which stalled well above the true minimum on weapons where the seed solve starts far from the floor. Switched to binary search between `[0, seed]`, converging in ~log₂ iterations — M16A1 now reports 2.34 instead of 3.0.
- **Max MOA constraint is now correctly enforced when the LP skips all COI-barrel mods**. Previously, for weapons where the barrel slot is optional and replacement barrels carry a `centerOfImpact`, the big-M constraints only bound *when* a COI-barrel was installed. If the LP chose to skip every COI-barrel (using the intrinsic COI instead), the constraint became vacuous and the user's cap could be silently violated. Added a fallback constraint using the weapon's intrinsic COI, guarded by the sum of barrel indicator variables so it only binds when no COI-barrel is installed.

## [v2.5.1] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Docker image no longer restart-loops on IPv6-enabled hosts**: nginx now listens on both IPv4 (`listen 80`) and IPv6 (`listen [::]:80`), and the container's HEALTHCHECK probes `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` to avoid IPv6 resolution ambiguity. Previously, on Docker daemons with IPv6 enabled, the healthcheck could resolve `localhost` to `::1`, fail against the v4-only nginx, mark the container unhealthy, and trigger a restart loop.
- Removed unused `constraints.reset` key from 14 non-en/zh locale files.

## [v2.5.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Max MOA constraint now honors replaceable barrels**: For weapons like the VPO-215 and M700, swapping to a different barrel correctly changes the displayed MOA and the hard-constraint limit uses the installed barrel's `centerOfImpact` (not the weapon's intrinsic one). LP uses an exact big-M per-barrel formulation.
- **Exact slider floor toggle** (new "精确下限" / "Exact slider floor" row under Max MOA): when on, the slider's minimum is computed by actually solving for the lowest achievable MOA (respects slot reachability, conflicts, and barrel-specific compatibility). When off, the minimum is a theoretical per-category estimate that may not be reachable in practice. Toggle state persists to localStorage.

### Fixed
- Slider range no longer includes the weapon's intrinsic `centerOfImpact` for weapons with a required replaceable-barrel slot — the intrinsic value is never reachable in those cases.
- Displayed final MOA now correctly reflects the installed barrel's COI instead of always using the weapon's intrinsic value.

## [v2.4.3] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Docker self-hosting support**: Multi-architecture (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) Docker images are now built and published to GitHub Container Registry on every release tag. Pull with `docker pull ghcr.io/ahaimk01/tarkov-optimizer-frontend:latest` — see README for the full quick-start recipe.
- Dockerfile and nginx config in `frontend/` support SPA fallback routing, correct WASM MIME handling, and tiered caching (immutable for hashed assets and `.wasm`, no-cache for locales and CHANGELOG).

## [v2.4.2] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- Language selector flags now render as SVG images (via `flag-icons`) instead of Unicode emoji, fixing broken display on Windows Chrome.
- Ternary plot (triangle weight picker) click and drag now works correctly in Chrome — dot no longer follows cursor on hover, only responds to click/drag.
- Fixed broken JSON syntax in 14 locale files (missing commas in constraints section).

## [v2.4.1] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- Mod categories now use **handbook categories** from the Tarkov.dev API, showing proper pluralized names (e.g. "Suppressors", "Magazines") instead of raw BSG category paths.
- Build result items display full handbook hierarchy path (e.g. "Weapon parts & mods > Functional mods > Suppressors") with leaf name shown in compact mode.

### Changed
- ModFilter category dropdown now uses antd built-in search filtering with inline +/- buttons per option.

### Fixed
- Fixed "Exclude dogtag barters" checkbox having no effect — the `barterExcludeDogtags` parameter was not passed to `getAvailablePrice` during LP construction.

## [v2.4.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- New **Table View** mode for results, providing a high-density spreadsheet layout for power users.
- Persistent view state (Detailed/Compact/Table) saved to local storage.

### Changed
- Refactored mobile item cards for improved readability and vertical alignment.
- Updated accuracy (Acc) tag colors to Orange to distinguish them from Recoil (Green).

### Fixed
- Fixed missing `useTranslation` import in manifest components.
- Removed nested scrollbars in result containers to restore clean native browser scrolling.
- Locked price/trader columns in table mode to prevent horizontal layout shift.
- Translated ~25 untranslated UI keys (table headers, tooltips, lock/ban labels, barter labels) across all 14 non-English locales.
- Translated `ui.on`/`ui.off` toggles for all locales (was showing English "On"/"Off").
- Added missing `trader` section to 14 locale files.
- Fixed ternary plot vertex label showing preset name ("纯后坐") instead of axis label ("后坐").
- Fixed zh.json explore constraint labels still in English (limit_price, limit_recoil, limit_ergo).
- Removed unused imports (Tooltip, Switch, Select) causing TypeScript build failures.
